How to use (for the first time)
-------------------------------
1. Make sure you have [Git][] on your system.

2. Clone my repo by running:

3. Run the following command and press `y` for the files you want to install:

        cd ~/.dotfiles
        git pull
        ./install

* If you want to send me your modifications, please put them up in your
  [GitHub][] fork and send me a pull request at [my
